Link & Sync is a tool for importing external assets and easily synchronizing changes when they occur.

Disclaimer: while every effort has been made to ensure that this system is as intuitive and bug-free as possible, you should always backup your projects regularly (even without this plugin). Kybernetik cannot be held responsible for any loss of data.

How to use:
1. Assets -> Create -> Link and Sync.
2. The Inspector is designed to be intuitive and has tooltips explaining each field.
3. Operations are normally performed based on each file's Date Modified. You can Right Click the Prepare button and use the Force function to ignore the dates and ensure that everything is copied.
